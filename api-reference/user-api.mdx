# User Login API

The following documentation provides details about the user login API in TypeScript using the Express.js framework.

## Endpoint

### POST /api/user/login

This endpoint is used for user authentication.

## Request Parameters

- `country_code` (String, required): The country code of the user.
- `mobile_no` (String, required): The mobile number of the user (must be 9 digits long).

## Middleware

The route is equipped with middleware for input validation. It checks that `country_code` is numeric and not empty, and `mobile_no` is numeric, not empty, and has a length of 9.

## Login Middleware (`loginMid`)

This middleware processes the login request.

### Flow:

- Validate input parameters using the defined middleware.
- If validation fails, return a validation error response using the `errorValidationResponse` function from the `commonController` module.
- If validation passes, call the `LOGIN` function from the `userApiController` module.

## `LOGIN` Function

This function handles the actual login process.

### Flow:

- Check conditions for specific test cases related to mobile numbers.
- Generate or retrieve an OTP (One-Time Password).
- Create a payload with `country_code`, `mobile_no`, `otp`, and `created_at`.
- Delete existing OTP records for the specified user.
- Create a new OTP record in the `otpModel`.
- Optionally, integrate with an SMS gateway to send the OTP to the user's mobile number.
- Return a success message.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// Example request
const data = {
  country_code: "1",
  mobile_no: "123456789",
};

// Making a request to the login API
app.post('/api/user/login', data, (response) => {
  console.log(response);
});






# Verify OTP API

## Endpoint

### POST /api/user/verify-otp

This endpoint is used to verify the OTP (One-Time Password) sent to the user's mobile number during login.

### Flow

- The country_code, mobile_no, and otp fields are required in the request body.
- OTP is checked against the stored OTP in the database for the provided mobile number.
- If OTP verification is successful, an authentication token is generated and returned.
- The authentication token is used for further authorized API requests.
- Error messages are returned for scenarios such as invalid OTP, OTP not generated, account not found, or internal server errors.
- The authentication token has a Bearer token type and should be included in the Authorization header for subsequent authenticated requests.
