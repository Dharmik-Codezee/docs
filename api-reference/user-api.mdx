# User Login API

The following documentation provides details about the user login API in TypeScript using the Express.js framework.

## Endpoint

### POST /api/user/login

This endpoint is used for user authentication.

## Request Parameters

- `country_code` (String, required): The country code of the user.
- `mobile_no` (String, required): The mobile number of the user (must be 9 digits long).

## Middleware

The route is equipped with middleware for input validation. It checks that `country_code` is numeric and not empty, and `mobile_no` is numeric, not empty, and has a length of 9.

## Login Middleware (`loginMid`)

This middleware processes the login request.

### Flow:

1. Validate input parameters using the defined middleware.
2. If validation fails, return a validation error response using the `errorValidationResponse` function from the `commonController` module.
3. If validation passes, call the `LOGIN` function from the `userApiController` module.

## `LOGIN` Function

This function handles the actual login process.

### Flow:

1. Check conditions for specific test cases related to mobile numbers.
2. Generate or retrieve an OTP (One-Time Password).
3. Create a payload with `country_code`, `mobile_no`, `otp`, and `created_at`.
4. Delete existing OTP records for the specified user.
5. Create a new OTP record in the `otpModel`.
6. Optionally, integrate with an SMS gateway to send the OTP to the user's mobile number.
7. Return a success message.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// Example request
const data = {
  country_code: "1",
  mobile_no: "123456789",
};

// Making a request to the login API
app.post('/api/user/login', data, (response) => {
  console.log(response);
});





# User SignUp API

The following documentation outlines the user sign-up API in TypeScript, utilizing the Express.js framework.

## Endpoint

### POST /api/user/signup

This endpoint is used for user registration.

## Request Parameters

- `user_type` (Number, required): The type of user being registered.
- `country_code` (String, required): The country code of the user.
- `mobile_no` (String, required): The mobile number of the user.
- `otp` (String, required): One-Time Password for verification.
- `first_name` (String, required): The first name of the user.

Optional Parameters:

- `user_email` (String): User's email address.
- Additional parameters based on user type.

## Middleware

The route is equipped with middleware for input validation. It checks the format of the provided parameters.

## SignUp Middleware (`userCreateMid`)

This middleware processes the sign-up request.

### Flow:

1. Validate input parameters using the defined middleware.
2. If validation fails, return a validation error response using the `errorValidationResponse` function from the `commonController` module.
3. If an email is provided and is not valid, return a validation error response.
4. If validation passes, call the `SIGNUP` function from the `userApiController` module.

## `SIGNUP` Function

This function handles the user registration process.

### Flow:

1. Check if the user already exists based on country code and mobile number.
2. If the user exists, return an error response.
3. Validate the user type, mobile number, and other required parameters.
4. Create a new user based on the provided information.
5. If the user type is 1 (Job Seeker) or 2 (Business Owner), perform additional steps based on the user type.
6. If successful, generate a JWT token and return it along with the user and business information.
